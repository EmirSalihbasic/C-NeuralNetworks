# CPP-NeuralNetworks

Neural Networks increased in recent years, particulary in the field of artifical intelligence and machine learning. They are versatile, they demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, they excel in handling large datasets and they enable automation of complex tasks.

C++ is highly compiled and very fast, it gives us control over the memory management. It can offer us better performance and maintainability for large codebases and complex software systems.

In this repository I will post:

a) SImple Sigmoid function (x = sigmoid(a*b+c))
b) Delta for Neuron (delta = outputError * sigmoidDerivative(predictedOutput))

I will also make some algorithms

1) Backpropriation in Finance
