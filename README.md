# CPP-NeuralNetworks

Neural Networks increased in recent years, particulary in the field of artifical intelligence and machine learning. They are versatile, they demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, they excel in handling large datasets and they enable automation of complex tasks.

C++ is highly compiled and very fast, it gives us control over the memory management. It can offer us better performance and maintainability for large codebases and complex software systems.

In this repository I will post:

1) Logic Gate (2 inputs, the one is true and the second one is false)
2) SImple Sigmoid function (x = sigmoid(a*b+c))
3) Delta for Neuron (delta = outputError * sigmoidDerivative(predictedOutput))

I will also make some algorithms:

1) Logic Gate with Perceptrons (2 inputs in perceptron class are created, bias and weights compared to true and false in Logic Gate without Perceptrons. We tested OR gate perceptron for all possible input combinations).

1) Multilayer Perceptron (one input layer, one hidden layer and one output layer). Used in functions where underlying relationships are compley, image recognition, text classification, in finance is used in stock prediction).

2) Backpropriation (included forward pass with a given input, Error calculation, Backpropriation, Weight and Bias Updates). Backpropagation is a training algorithm used to adjust the weights and biases of a neural network to minimize prediction errors.
